description: First published in Scribner's Magazine in 1915, Edith Wharton's Coming
  home is a short story of seven chapters that centers around the life of a French
  man named Jean de Réchamp during the war. The story is narrated in the first-personal
  pronoun and bases itself on reports about the atrocities committed by the German
  army. Jean de Réchamp, who is engaged to Mlle. Malo, wants to know about his family
  that he left in his home country just before the war was declared. On a journey
  back to his home town Réchamp in Eastern France, the roads seem eerily empty save
  for the sentinels guarding the railways. Even the names of towns and roads are scratched
  out off the milestones in order to mislead the enemy. Fortunately, Jean knows his
  directions and finally reaches Réchamp with his companions who include a wounded
  man. When they reach the town, an old woman as well as other countrymen tell them
  about the atrocities of the what has happened and how the village has been destroyed.
  Jean finally meets his family. However, by the end of the narrative, the wounded
  companion dies.
